# Data Structures & Algorithms

A collection of notes I wrote and have organized for future reference going over data structures and algorithms.

Mainly taken from and inspired by [ThePrimeagen's](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) data structures and algorithms course.
[The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).

Examples and implementations are written in TypeScript!
