Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving problems. It's kind of like a recipe for getting something done.

In order to bake a pie we should follow a set of steps in the correct order exactly as specified by a recipe to get a predictable outcome. Algorithms used in computer programming are more complex, but follow a similar philosophy to a baking recipe.
